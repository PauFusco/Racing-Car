# Racing-Car

In this game you control your incredible car to complete the course that Makima entrusted you. Dont worry because falling from the platform will transport you to a new dimension where you can try again. You also have 60 seconds before the reality in which you run collapses on itself, making you try again and again.
Images will hunt you while running, so don't get distracted!

Running on dirt and water will be difficult, so be careful!! (Friction there is different, so remeber to adapt. As Einstein said: Intelligence is the ability to change)
